A Mail Access Checker is a tool or software that allows users to check if an email account is active and valid. The tool usually checks the validity of an email address by verifying if it exists and can receive messages. The checker may also provide information about the email account such as its existence, domain status, and mail server details.

Please note that using a Mail Access Checker to validate someone else's email address without their consent is unethical and potentially illegal, as it violates their privacy.
